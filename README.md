# PsyAI

PsyAI is an open-source framework that aims to build a seamless switchover service between human experts and reviewers with their AI agent counterparts in Agentic workflows.

Building off the work done on the [Centaur Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20268) created by a team from the Institute for Human-Centered AI at Helmholtz Munich, PsyAI aims to use this 'foundation model for human cognition' to make transitions between humans and AI agents more seamless with a greatly reduced cognitive load. 

The primary hypothesis is as follows: If an LLM trained on psychology data predicts human decisions with >80% accuracy, then humans can make better decisions faster in agentic applications using a proxy agent framework. The secondary hypothesis being, expert users experiencing repetitive LLM training and decision-making workflows will benefit from a predictive decision framework that reduces decision fatigue and cognitive load.

Work on the PsyAI project aims to further research in the field of Human-in-the-loop applications, and LLM-as-a-judge amongst others. To that effect the PsyAI core team is working towards the goal of running a study in Q1 of 2026 with the outcome being a published paper on this subject. 

Currently, the team has slots open for additional members, contributors, and advisors on the core team, [inquire here](https://forms.gle/TCPKzSc9Z8H4m8LH7). Contributors to the codebase are always welcome under MIT creative commons licensing.


## High-Level Design

The ultimate goal of this project is to achieve seamless AI to Human conversations attuned on a subconscious level based on foundational components of human cognition.
