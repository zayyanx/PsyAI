# Chat Session Log - November 17, 2025

## User Prompt
"Create a directory structure and use the markdown file in the Collaborative Writing directory as the base outline file for the final paper"

## Response Summary
The assistant created a comprehensive documentation system within the Collaborative Writing directory including: (1) a chat_history directory with this session log, (2) an Artifacts directory containing the base outline file for the research paper, and (3) proper Git version control for all session artifacts. The base outline covers the complete research paper structure including Introduction, Materials and Methods (with detailed development framework and product requirements), Results, and Discussion sections.

## Decisions Made
1. **Directory Structure**: Created two main directories within Collaborative Writing/:
   - `chat_history/` - for logging all chat sessions with timestamped markdown files
   - `Artifacts/` - for storing generated documents, outputs, and project artifacts with version control

2. **Base Outline Selection**: Used "Collaborative Writing/psyAI Research Paper - Outline 2.md" as the authoritative base outline for the final research paper, which includes:
   - Research hypotheses on proxy agent framework for human-AI decision-making
   - Detailed materials and methods including Agile development epics and stories
   - Product requirements (backend, frontend, integration, performance)
   - Expected results and discussion framework

3. **Artifact Management**: Created a timestamped copy of the base outline in the Artifacts directory to serve as the foundation for the final paper development

4. **Version Control**: Committed all new files to Git with a descriptive commit message documenting the session

## Session Outcome
Successfully established a project management infrastructure for tracking chat sessions and artifacts within the Collaborative Writing workspace. The base outline for the PsyAI research paper is now documented and version-controlled, providing a clear framework for developing the final paper. The outline describes a comprehensive study on using LLM-based proxy agents to predict human decisions in agentic AI workflows, with the goal of reducing decision fatigue and improving efficiency. Project Tasks.md was not found in the repository, indicating this may be a new documentation initiative.

## Next Steps
1. Begin developing the full research paper based on the outline structure
2. Implement the development framework described in the Materials and Methods section (3 Epics with associated user stories)
3. Create detailed technical specifications for the backend API and frontend UI
4. Establish data collection protocols for the experimental study
5. Consider creating a Project Tasks.md file to track daily tasks and priorities
